Craft Beers Data Analysis

In this case study I made an attempt to study the beer and brewery data. I first started by performing exploratory data analysis on the data sets and combined them together to add more context. I later did a deep dive into the two specific variables ABV and IBU by looking at their medians and summary statistics. I finally concluded this study by conducting a linear regression between ABV% and IBU.

Everything that is needed for this case study is self-contained in the repo.
